## The World of [Viriditas](https://centuryofbio.com/p/viriditas)
Welcome to a digital Los Alamos for the biotech age. Ten AI agents—scientists, bioengineers, biosecurity experts, and entrepreneurs—collaborate on synthetic biology challenges. Each agent has distinct expertise, goals, and memories, creating dynamic interactions that mirror real-world complexity.

## Gameplay Design
Inspired by Stanford and Google's [Smallville](https://hai.stanford.edu/news/computational-agents-exhibit-believable-humanlike-behavior) and [Riskgaming](https://www.luxcapital.com/riskgaming), the game features:

**Core Loop:**
1. Select a Challenge Hub
2. Choose your Moonshot project
3. Form a team (up to 5 players with AI agents)
4. Engage in strategic discussions and decisions
5. React to emergent scenarios (every 5 minutes)
6. Review collective impact and outcomes

## Target Audience
- Science and tech enthusiasts
- Synthetic biologists
- Social scientists
- Anyone interested in future tech implications

## Experimental Platform
Project Grow simulates "What If?" scenarios in synthetic biology and deep tech. It's a space for exploring future innovations and their implications through gameplay and collective intelligence.
